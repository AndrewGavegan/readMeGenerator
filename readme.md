## Installation
        To install this application, the user runs the “index.js” file in Node. Running the index file will prompt the user for a series of questions relating to the creation of a README file. Using a template literal, the user input is then assigned to elements and then written to a new file, which is named based on the name of the application for which the README is being written. The README file is created in the same directory as the index file and when opened in the browser, will show as a polished marked README document.
